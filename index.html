      <p>
          I’m Justin Rodriguez, a Network Security Operations Analyst specializing in event monitoring, incident response, and enterprise network defense. 
          I proactively monitor 200+ networks using tools like SolarWinds, Cisco vManage, Juniper Mist, Citrix, and Microsoft Defender, driving resolution during major incidents and escalating appropriately to restore services. 
          Certified in CompTIA Security+ and CySA+, I apply proven security practices to detect, analyze, and respond to threats in real time. My background includes a B.A. in Computer Science (Cyber Security focus) and an A.A.S. in Cyber Security, providing both the technical foundation and hands-on expertise to safeguard enterprise systems.

    <h3>Career Focus & Opportunities</h3>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
            I am open to a wide range of cybersecurity roles where I can stay close to the technology, including blue team operations, SOC and NSOC analysis, cloud security, and security engineering. 
            I enjoy working directly with alerts, logs, and monitoring tools to understand what is happening in an environment and help the team respond quickly and effectively. 
            Through my internship and personal projects I have also created policies, diagrams, and security documentation, which strengthened my understanding of governance, risk, and compliance.
            Long term, I hope to grow into GRC and security governance roles where I can connect day-to-day operations with broader organizational risk and compliance goals.

    <h3>Professional Experience</h3>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>Rooms To Go – NSOC Analyst</h4>
      <p>
        I work in the Network Security Operations Center monitoring more than 200 networks for both performance
        and security issues. I use tools like Juniper Mist, Cisco vManage, SolarWinds, and Microsoft Defender to
        investigate alerts, validate whether something is a real threat or a false positive, and coordinate with
        other teams to resolve incidents. I also help maintain access controls and Conditional Access policies so
        only the right users can reach critical systems.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>TheIncLab – Cybersecurity Intern</h4>
      <p>
        I supported cybersecurity work for R&amp;D projects by helping apply the Risk Management Framework (RMF)
        and align controls with NIST and CMMC requirements. I wrote and edited security policies, built system and
        data flow diagrams, and monitored events with Wazuh SIEM. A big part of the role was turning technical
        findings into clear documentation that engineers and leadership could actually use.

    <!-- AI Content Moderation Report -->
    <div class="card">
      <h4>AI Content Moderation: A Critical Examination of AI in Social Media and Future Directions</h4>
      <p>
        A research report exploring how artificial intelligence can be applied to social media moderation.
        I analyzed algorithms for detecting harmful content, user behavior patterns, and bot activity, while
        also addressing ethical and privacy concerns around automated decision-making.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why I did it:</strong> To connect academic research with real-world cybersecurity and online safety challenges.</p>
      <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> Gained deeper insight into AI-driven moderation techniques, algorithmic bias, and the tradeoffs between automation, privacy, and platform security.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>S-SDLC Security Alert Framework: Identifying and Mitigating Risks in Open-Source Packages</h4>
      <p>
        A structured security guide built from Socket.Dev alerts to help development teams evaluate open-source
        software packages and their dependencies. The document defines severity levels (critical, high, medium, low),
        describes the associated risks, and provides mitigation steps to protect application integrity throughout the
        secure software development lifecycle.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why I did it:</strong> To give developers a clear, repeatable way to assess package risk and make informed decisions when introducing third-party code.</p>
      <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> Strengthened my understanding of software supply chain risk, vulnerability classification, and how to translate raw security alerts into developer-friendly guidance and documentation.</p>
