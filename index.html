  <h3>Professional Summary</h3>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      I’m Justin Rodriguez, a Network Security Operations Analyst specializing in event monitoring, incident response, and enterprise network defense.
      I proactively monitor 200+ networks using tools like SolarWinds, Cisco vManage, Juniper Mist, Citrix, and Microsoft Defender, driving resolution during major incidents and escalating appropriately to restore services.
      Certified in CompTIA Security+ and CySA+, I apply proven security practices to detect, analyze, and respond to threats in real time. My background includes a B.A. in Computer Science (Cyber Security focus) and an A.A.S. in Cyber Security, providing both the technical foundation and hands-on expertise to safeguard enterprise systems.

  <h3>Career Focus & Opportunities</h3>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      I am open to a wide range of cybersecurity roles where I can stay close to the technology, including blue team operations, SOC and NSOC analysis, cloud security, and security engineering.
      I enjoy working directly with alerts, logs, and monitoring tools to understand what is happening in an environment and help the team respond quickly and effectively.
      Through my internship and personal projects I have also created policies, diagrams, and security documentation, which strengthened my understanding of governance, risk, and compliance.
      Long term, I hope to grow into GRC and security governance roles where I can connect day-to-day operations with broader organizational risk and compliance goals.

  <h3>Professional Experience</h3>

  <div class="card">
    <h4>Rooms To Go – NSOC Analyst</h4>
    <p>
      I work in the Network Security Operations Center monitoring more than 200 networks for both performance
      and security issues. I use tools like Juniper Mist, Cisco vManage, SolarWinds, and Microsoft Defender to
      investigate alerts, validate whether something is a real threat or a false positive, and coordinate with
      other teams to resolve incidents.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h4>TheIncLab – Cybersecurity Intern</h4>
    <p>
      I supported cybersecurity work for R&amp;D projects by helping apply the Risk Management Framework (RMF)
      and align controls with NIST and CMMC requirements. I wrote and edited security policies, built system and
      data flow diagrams, and monitored events with Wazuh SIEM.

    <h4>Project Spotlight: Secure Encrypted Chat Dashboard</h4>

    <div class="desktop-only">
      <p>
        I built a Python-based desktop application using Tkinter to make cryptography practical. It allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt text or files using three major symmetric algorithms: AES, DES, and 3DES. The tool focuses on real-world security by using PBKDF2 and a salt to turn passphrases into strong cryptographic keys. It also features a real-time performance logger and graph to compare the speed of the three algorithms.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Why I Did It:</strong>
        My goal was to move beyond theory and tackle the practical challenges of encryption. I wanted to see how algorithms truly behave, how to securely manage user passphrases using SHA-256 hashing and key derivation, and what engineering issues arise. When I ran into compatibility problems with Python's native crypto libraries, I pivoted to integrating OpenSSL via subprocess calls.
      </p>

      <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Secure passphrase handling with PBKDF2 and SHA-256</li>
        <li>Performance differences between AES, DES, and 3DES</li>
        <li>System-level cryptography integration using OpenSSL</li>
        <li>End-to-end desktop application design</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
