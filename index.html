    <h3>Professional Summary</h3>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
      I work as an NSOC Analyst, monitoring 200+ business networks in real time, triaging incidents, and escalating major incidents to keep services operational and downtime to a minimum. 
      Daily, I utilize SolarWinds, Cisco vManage, Juniper Mist, and Citrix to track availability and performance issues, then validate their impact and work with the appropriate teams or vendors to resolve the issues. 
      On the security front, I work as an L2 analyst, utilizing Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Sentinel to resolve escalated events that third-party providers are unable to resolve, confirm what is legitimate versus noise, and drive the next steps through containment and escalation as needed.

        I work in the Network Security Operations Center monitoring more than 200 networks for both performance
        and security issues. I use tools like Juniper Mist, Cisco vManage, SolarWinds, and Microsoft Defender to
        investigate alerts, validate whether something is a real threat or a false positive, and coordinate with
        other teams to resolve incidents. I also help maintain access controls and Conditional Access policies so
        only the right users can reach critical systems.

      <h4>Secure Encrypted Chat </h4>

      <p>
        I built a Python based desktop application using Tkinter to make cryptography practical.
        It allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt text or files using AES, DES, and 3DES.
        The tool focuses on real world security by using PBKDF2 and a salt to turn passphrases
        into strong cryptographic keys. It also includes a real time performance logger and
        graph to compare the speed of each algorithm.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Why I Did It:</strong>
        I built this project because I was tired of just reading about cryptography.
        I wanted to jump into the deep end and see how AES, DES, and key derivation actually work in a real program.
        My core motivation was to gain a hands-on understanding of secure passphrase management (using hashing like SHA-256) and how these algorithms behave in a real-world system.
      </p>

      <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed a strong understanding of secure passphrase handling using PBKDF2 and SHA 256, and the distinction between a passphrase and a cryptographic key.</li>
        <li>Measured and compared encryption and decryption performance using high resolution timing, confirming AES as the fastest and observing unexpected real world differences between DES and 3DES.</li>
        <li>Gained hands on experience integrating system level tools like OpenSSL into a Python application for broader compatibility.</li>
        <li>Connected GUI design, user input validation, encryption logic, file handling, and performance analysis into a single cohesive application.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>S-SDLC Security Alert Framework (Document)</h4>
      <p>
        A structured security guide built from Socket.Dev alerts to help development teams evaluate open-source
        software packages and their dependencies. The document defines severity levels (critical, high, medium, low),
        describes the associated risks, and provides mitigation steps to protect application integrity throughout the
        secure software development lifecycle.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why I did it:</strong> To give developers a clear, repeatable way to assess package risk and make informed decisions when introducing third-party code.</p>
      <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> Strengthened my understanding of software supply chain risk, vulnerability classification, and how to translate raw security alerts into developer-friendly guidance and documentation.</p>

      <h4>AI Content Moderation: A Critical Examination of AI in Social Media and Future Directions</h4>
      <p>
        A research report exploring how artificial intelligence can be applied to social media moderation.
        I analyzed algorithms for detecting harmful content, user behavior patterns, and bot activity, while
        also addressing ethical and privacy concerns around automated decision-making.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why I did it:</strong> To connect academic research with real-world cybersecurity and online safety challenges.</p>
      <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> Gained deeper insight into AI-driven moderation techniques, algorithmic bias, and the tradeoffs between automation, privacy, and platform security.</p>
