    <h3>Career Focus & Opportunities</h3>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        I am open to a wide range of cybersecurity roles where I can stay close to the technology, including blue team operations, SOC and NSOC analysis, cloud security, and security engineering.
        I enjoy working directly with alerts, logs, and monitoring tools to understand what is happening in an environment and help the team respond quickly and effectively.
        Through my internship and personal projects I have also created policies, diagrams, and security documentation, which strengthened my understanding of governance, risk, and compliance.
        Long term, I hope to grow into GRC and security governance roles where I can connect day-to-day operations with broader organizational risk and compliance goals.

    <div class="card">
      <h4>Rooms To Go – NSOC Analyst</h4>
      <p>
        I work in the Network Security Operations Center monitoring more than 200 networks for both performance
        and security issues. I use tools like Juniper Mist, Cisco vManage, SolarWinds, and Microsoft Defender to
        investigate alerts, validate whether something is a real threat or a false positive, and coordinate with
        other teams to resolve incidents. I also help maintain access controls and Conditional Access policies so
        only the right users can reach critical systems.
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>TheIncLab – Cybersecurity Intern</h4>
      <p>
        I supported cybersecurity work for R&amp;D projects by helping apply the Risk Management Framework (RMF)
        and align controls with NIST and CMMC requirements. I wrote and edited security policies, built system and
        data flow diagrams, and monitored events with Wazuh SIEM. A big part of the role was turning technical
        findings into clear documentation that engineers and leadership could actually use.

      <h4>Secure Encrypted Chat</h4>

      <p>
        I built a Python based desktop application using Tkinter to make cryptography practical.
        It allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt text or files using AES, DES, and 3DES.
        The tool focuses on real world security by using PBKDF2 and a salt to turn passphrases
        into strong cryptographic keys. It also includes a real time performance logger and
        graph to compare the speed of each algorithm.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Why I Did It:</strong>
        I built this project because I was tired of just reading about cryptography.
        I wanted to jump into the deep end and see how AES, DES, and key derivation actually work in a real program.
        My core motivation was to gain a hands-on understanding of secure passphrase management (using hashing like SHA-256) and how these algorithms behave in a real-world system.
      </p>

      <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed a strong understanding of secure passphrase handling using PBKDF2 and SHA 256, and the distinction between a passphrase and a cryptographic key.</li>
        <li>Measured and compared encryption and decryption performance using high resolution timing, confirming AES as the fastest and observing unexpected real world differences between DES and 3DES.</li>
        <li>Gained hands on experience integrating system level tools like OpenSSL into a Python application for broader compatibility.</li>
        <li>Connected GUI design, user input validation, encryption logic, file handling, and performance analysis into a single cohesive application.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>S-SDLC Security Alert Framework (Document)</h4>
      <p>
        A structured security guide built from Socket.Dev alerts to help development teams evaluate open-source
        software packages and their dependencies. The document defines severity levels (critical, high, medium, low),
        describes the associated risks, and provides mitigation steps to protect application integrity throughout the
        secure software development lifecycle.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why I did it:</strong> To give developers a clear, repeatable way to assess package risk and make informed decisions when introducing third-party code.</p>
      <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> Strengthened my understanding of software supply chain risk, vulnerability classification, and how to translate raw security alerts into developer-friendly guidance and documentation.</p>

      <h4>AI Content Moderation: A Critical Examination of AI in Social Media and Future Directions</h4>
      <p>
        A research report exploring how artificial intelligence can be applied to social media moderation.
        I analyzed algorithms for detecting harmful content, user behavior patterns, and bot activity, while
        also addressing ethical and privacy concerns around automated decision-making.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why I did it:</strong> To connect academic research with real-world cybersecurity and online safety challenges.</p>
      <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> Gained deeper insight into AI-driven moderation techniques, algorithmic bias, and the tradeoffs between automation, privacy, and platform security.</p>
