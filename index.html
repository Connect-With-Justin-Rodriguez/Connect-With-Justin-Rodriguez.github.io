  <h3>Professional Summary</h3>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      I’m Justin Rodriguez, a Network Security Operations Analyst specializing in event monitoring,
      incident response, and enterprise network defense. I proactively monitor 200+ networks using
      SolarWinds, Cisco vManage, Juniper Mist, Citrix, and Microsoft Defender, driving resolution
      during major incidents and escalating appropriately to restore services. Certified in CompTIA
      Security+ and CySA+, I apply proven security practices to detect, analyze, and respond to
      threats in real time.

  <h3>Professional Experience</h3>

  <div class="card">
    <h4>Rooms To Go – NSOC Analyst</h4>
    <p>
      I work in the Network Security Operations Center monitoring more than 200 networks for
      performance and security issues. I use tools like Juniper Mist, Cisco vManage, SolarWinds,
      and Microsoft Defender to investigate alerts, validate whether something is a real threat,
      and coordinate with other teams to resolve incidents.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h4>TheIncLab – Cybersecurity Intern</h4>
    <p>
      I supported cybersecurity work for R&D projects by applying the Risk Management Framework
      and aligning controls with NIST and CMMC requirements. I wrote security policies, built
      system and data flow diagrams, and monitored events using Wazuh SIEM.

    <h4>Project Spotlight: Secure Encrypted Chat Dashboard</h4>

    <div class="desktop-only">
      <p>
        I built a Python-based desktop application using Tkinter to make cryptography practical.
        It allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt text or files using AES, DES, and 3DES.
        The tool uses PBKDF2 with salting to convert passphrases into strong cryptographic keys and
        includes real-time performance logging to compare encryption speed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Why I Did It:</strong>
        My goal was to move beyond theory and tackle the practical challenges of encryption,
        including secure key handling, algorithm performance, and system-level integration
        using OpenSSL.
      </p>

      <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Secure passphrase handling with PBKDF2 and SHA-256</li>
        <li>Real-world performance differences between AES, DES, and 3DES</li>
        <li>System-level cryptography integration using OpenSSL</li>
        <li>End-to-end desktop application design</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mobile-only">
      <p>
        A Python desktop encryption tool using AES, DES, and 3DES with PBKDF2-based key derivation,
        focused on secure key handling and real-world performance testing.

    <h4>S-SDLC Security Alert Framework: Identifying and Mitigating Risks in Open-Source Packages</h4>
    <p>
      A structured security guide built from Socket.Dev alerts to help development teams evaluate
      open-source software packages and their dependencies across the secure software development lifecycle.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Why I did it:</strong> To give developers a repeatable way to assess package risk.</p>
    <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> Software supply chain risk and vulnerability classification.</p>
